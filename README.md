# MyJournal
An online journal to track progress of projects

The project MyJournal is an online journal wherein student updates with the list of tasks and the deadlines of projects and assignments to be completed. 
It keeps track of the events that are to be completed and allows the user to modify edit and delete the entered records.
It stores all the past records of the events and displays all the events that have happened so far as a list so that the person need not take pain to write it in some journal manually. 
It also keeps track of the amount of time spent for a particular module or assignment in a single button click. 
It can also be used for performance analysis.
